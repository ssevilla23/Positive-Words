# ðŸ’Œ Encouraging Words
The Encouraging Words website is a simple, interactive space
designed to uplift users by allowing them to create personalized,
positive messages to themselves. This project was built using
JavaScript and with a focus on experimenting with the text-to-speech functionality.

This website offers:

+ **Personalized Messages**: Users can input their name, a custom positive message, and optionally a postscript for extra self-encouragement.
+ **Text-to-Speech**: The message is read back to the user by a randomly selected text-to-speech voice, making the experience more engaging.
